                    <dt> 1. What is the general aim of this research? </dt>
                    <dd>The experiment you participated in today is part of a study investigating the impact of different adaptive 
                            spacing algorithms on recall. An adaptive spacing algorithm is an algorithm that changes the order items are shown 
                            to you based on your performance during the session. We are interested in whether your memory will be better using
                            one of these algorithms compared to the others. </dd>

                    <dt>2. Is this correlational or experimental research?</dt>
                    <dd>The study you participated in represents experimental research. The independent variable we manipulated
                        was the algorithm used to schedule your items and the
                        dependent variable we are interested in is your performance on a final test. We predict that practicing
                        the adaptive algorithms will not have significantly different performance from each other. </dd>

                    <dt>4. Where can I learn more about this type of research?</dt>
                    <dd>If you are interested in learning more about adaptive spacing algorithms, here are two relevant references:

                            <dt>5. Who is conducting this research?</dt>
                            <dd>This research is being conducted by members of the Cognition and Learning Laboratory at Purdue
                                University, under the direction of Dr. Jeffrey D. Karpicke, a Professor in the
                                Department of Psychological Sciences. You may contact the laboratory via email at <a href="mailto:learninglab@purdue.edu"
                                    target="_top">learninglab@purdue.edu</a>, and you can learn more about our research at our
                                website,
                                <a href="http://learninglab.psych.purdue.edu/">http://learninglab.psych.purdue.edu/</a>.</dd>

                            <dd>A lot of research in psychology depends on the participation of individuals like you. We are
                                very grateful for your help. Thank you very much for participating.</dd>
