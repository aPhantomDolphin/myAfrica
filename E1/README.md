# Framework

## Initial setup

Setup this Framework using:

```
git clone https://github.com/PCLLAB/Framework.git
cd Framework
git clone https://github.com/PCLLAB/jsPsych-Plugins.git plugins
```

## Creating a new experiment

To create a new experiment, first setup the framework according to the steps above.

Next, copy over the files in the framework folder except for the plugins folder. Once that is done, create a folder named plugins. Then, copy over the plugins you intend to use from the plugins folder in framework to the plugins folder you just created.
